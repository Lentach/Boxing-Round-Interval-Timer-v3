# Background and Motivation

This project is a web-based Boxing Round Interval Timer. The user requested to set up a local development environment using npm, allowing for easy development and live reloading. The project consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JS, media) and now includes a minimal Node.js setup for serving the app locally.

**New feature:** The user can now set the round duration in either minutes or seconds using a min/sec toggle in the interface.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- The project did not originally have a `package.json`, only a `package-lock.json`, which prevented npm scripts from running.
- There was no development server or script to serve the static files for local development.
- The terminal output indicated a missing conda executable, but this did not block npm operations.
- The default port 3000 was in use, so `live-server` automatically switched to another port.
- Multiple 404 errors for `/favicon.ico` were logged, which is a minor issue but does not affect core functionality.
- Detected file changes (audio files, package.json) triggered live reloads as expected.
- There are 6 npm vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 4 high) in the current setup.
- **New challenge:** Ensure correct handling of different time units (minutes/seconds) in the timer logic and UI.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Create a minimal `package.json`**
   - Success: `package.json` exists with a `dev` script using `live-server`.
2. **Install development dependencies**
   - Success: `live-server` is installed via npm.
3. **Run the development server**
   - Success: `npm run dev` starts a local server and serves `index.html`.
4. **Check for npm vulnerabilities**
   - Success: Run `npm audit` and document results.
5. **Resolve favicon 404 warnings**
   - Success: Add a `favicon.ico` or suppress the warning.
6. **Document lessons and solutions**
   - Success: All issues, solutions, and reusable knowledge are recorded in this scratchpad.
7. **[NEW] Add min/sec toggle for round duration**
   - Success: The user can select the unit (minutes or seconds) for round duration, and the timer works correctly for both options.
8. **[NEW] Add halfway sound and refactor audio files to audio/ folder**
   - Success: A sound is played at the halfway point of each round, and all audio files are loaded from the audio/ directory.

# Project Status Board

- [x] Create minimal `package.json` with dev script
- [x] Install `live-server` as a dev dependency
- [x] Run `npm run dev` to serve the app
- [x] Run `npm audit` and review vulnerabilities
- [ ] Add a `favicon.ico` to resolve 404 warnings (optional)
- [x] Review and address npm vulnerabilities (user decided to leave as-is)
- [x] Added min/sec toggle for round duration
- [x] Added halfway sound and refactored audio files to audio/ folder

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The development server is running and the app is accessible locally.
- There are 6 npm vulnerabilities; user should decide if these need to be addressed now.
- The repeated 404 errors for `/favicon.ico` are cosmetic but can be fixed by adding a favicon file.
- The conda error in the terminal profile is unrelated to this project but may be worth fixing for a cleaner shell experience.
- Ran `npm audit`. There are 6 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 4 high), mainly in `live-server` and its dependencies (`braces`, `chokidar`, `micromatch`, `anymatch`, `readdirp`).
- Full fix requires running `npm audit fix --force`, which will upgrade `live-server` to a breaking version (1.2.0). User approval is required before proceeding with `--force`.
- No immediate action taken; awaiting user decision on whether to attempt the breaking upgrade or leave as-is for now.
- User decided to leave the vulnerabilities as-is and not perform the breaking upgrade. Review of vulnerabilities is complete for now.

# Lessons

- Always ensure both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are present for npm projects.
- If a port is in use, `live-server` will automatically select another port.
- Missing `favicon.ico` will result in repeated 404s in the dev server logs; add a favicon to resolve.
- If npm reports vulnerabilities, run `npm audit` and consider running `npm audit fix` (avoid `--force` unless necessary and with user approval).
- Ignore unrelated shell/profile errors unless they block project progress.
- Always read files before editing, and document all changes and issues in the scratchpad for future reference.
- Store all audio files in a dedicated `audio/` directory for better organization and easier management.
